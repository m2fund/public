# M2fund public assets
Normally all our corporative repos are private. But from time to time we need some assets to be public (meaning some external service could have access to it).

For example `@tonconnect/ui-react` npm library expects us to provide `tonconnect-manifest.json` public url for `TonConnectUIProvider`.

### Public URLs
In order to get a file public link follow these steps:

1. Click at desired file

2. Show file in `Raw` mode

3. Copy its URL
